# Creta Emergency Assistant — Prototype v1 (Qdrant + FastAPI + React)

This is a **first iteration** prototype aligned to the prompt:  
Users type an emergency scenario (e.g., "battery dead", "engine overheating", "flat tire") and the system instantly
retrieves **step-by-step emergency procedures**, **safety warnings/cautions**, and **required tools** from the Hyundai Creta owner’s manual (focus on Part 8).

✅ **Best for demos / MVP validation**  
⚠️ Not a replacement for professional assistance or emergency services.
