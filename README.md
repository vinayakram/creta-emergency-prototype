# Creta Emergency Assistant — Prototype v1

A **manual-grounded emergency guidance assistant** for the Hyundai Creta owner’s manual.

This prototype helps users quickly find **safe, structured, and traceable instructions** during vehicle-related emergency situations — without relying on generic chatbots.

---

## What this project does

After setup, you will have a **local website** running on your computer where you can type questions like:

- “My battery is dead. How do I jump-start?”
- “Engine overheating — what should I do?”
- “Flat tire — how do I change the wheel?”

For each question, the assistant returns:

- ✅ **Step-by-step instructions**
- ⚠️ **Warnings / cautions / notices**
- 🛠 **Required tools**
- 📖 **Sources** (exact excerpts from the owner’s manual)

All answers are **grounded in the official Hyundai Creta owner’s manual**.  
This is **not** a generic AI chatbot.

---

## Why this approach

Vehicle emergencies require **accuracy and safety**.

This system:
- Searches only the owner’s manual
- Avoids mixing unrelated procedures
- Produces **structured output**, not free-form text
- Shows sources so answers can be verified

This makes it suitable for **technical demos, internal reviews, and proof-of-concepts**.

---

## High-level flow (no technical knowledge needed)

1. You type a question in the browser
2. The backend searches the manual using semantic search
3. Relevant manual sections are retrieved
4. The system extracts:
   - steps
   - warnings
   - tools
5. A structured response is sent back to the website

## Run the prototype (5 steps)

### Step 1 — Backend setup
```
01_SETUP_BACKEND.bat
```

### Step 2 — Ingest manual
```
02_INGEST_MANUAL.bat
```

### Step 3 — Start backend (keep open)

## Troubleshooting

- **PDF not found** → Check `backend\data\creta_manual.pdf`
- **Backend errors** → Ensure ingestion ran and backend is open
- **py not found** → Reinstall Python with launcher enabled

---

## Intended use

- Technical demos
- Proof-of-concepts
- Internal evaluations
- Technical sales walkthroughs

Not intended for production.
